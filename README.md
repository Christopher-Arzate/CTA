# CTA
A few weeks ago, I learned how the State Governement needed to sign a budget bill so public transportation such as Metra, CTA, and Pace can function normally in the state. I gotten curious on how impactful public transportation are for people so I organized a project to answer this question. The data used for this project was from the Chicago Data Portal finding data tables that contains any information about the trains. 

## Tools used
This project required me to learn how to run and manage a postgreSQL server, create and input csv files into databases. I utilize SQL to write queries to join tables by their station name to get which color line these station are in. Utilize Subqueries to filter datasets to find the stations with the most riderships on average. I learned how to import data from my SQL database into PowerBi and create a custom dashboard highlighting findings on this project.
